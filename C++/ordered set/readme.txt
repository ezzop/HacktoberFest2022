This code is about use of ordered set and a nice blog to read about it is https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/11080

There are mainly four properties of ordered set which are :
1. insert: to insert a value
2.erase: to remove a value
3. find_by_order(k): returns an iterator pointing to kth value starting from 0
4. order_of_key(x): return of values which are strictly less than x

We did these using inbuilt function of ordered set once and using set tree once in code1 and code2 respectively.
